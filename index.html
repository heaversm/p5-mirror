        <h3>Distance of reflected object between two parallel plane mirrors</h3>
        <div>
          <p>An object placed between two parallel plane mirrors will create infinite reflections, with each mirror acting as a point of reflection for its opposite reflected object.</p>
          <p>The horizontal distance an object is from the mirror is equal to the distance between the mirror and its reflection.</p>
          <p>In the diagram below, The green circle is the observer, the dark red triangle is the object being reflected, the dark blue lines are the mirror, and the subsequent triangles are reflections (only 2 of infinite reflections are pictured)</p>
          <p>Given this information, predict the distance between the mirror on the right <strong>(M2)</strong> and its 2nd reflection <strong>(R2)</strong>.</p>
